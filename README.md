How to properly contribute on GitHub and FOSS projects

Act I: The Issue

"And Richard Stallman hath said, 
Let there be free and open source software!"

GNU Chapter 1 Verse 6

Finding bugs and crashing and breaking software is encouraged as it helps the development process.
It's encouraged to find bugs and crashes and then make an issue on GitHub.

When making an issue on GitHub or any version control software, remember to:
1. Be Polite, treat others how you want to be treated, if you are rude you most likely will be told user error and the issue will be closed
2. Provide as much info about the problem as needed
3. Wait a couple days, devs have personal lives too.

What to do:

Tom's Issue: The c key does not work in the second fireplace gui. Here are the logs! Thanks!
Logs.txt

*2 days later*

James: The problem is that there is an extra "," in the gui code. I have made a fork and pull request.

What NOT to do:

Tom (but stupid):your code sucks nerd lololol make functional software lmao ðŸ¤£ the code broke hahahaha I clicked 3 buttons that don't work and my game crashed

*2 days later*

James: user error
*issue closed*

Act II: The Fork and Pull Request

The fork is a way to test and change code from the main branch of code,
if the code doesn't work, you can keep changing it or even cut it off by deleting it. After your branch/fork is 
sucessful and works you can make a pull request and have it applied to the main branch

Don't pull as a joke or make pull requests that are malicious, such things are potentially bannable from GitHub.
You can fork and pull request all you want, forking is very encouraged.

What to do: 

Implement performance improvements or other code changes

What not to do:

Add so much code that the devs don't want to look through all of it and add malicious code into the fork, get it pulled 
and added until someone notices notifies the right people and gets it removed, getting your account potentially suspended.

Just have common sense.
The End.
